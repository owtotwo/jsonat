1. Output the escape charactors in form like '\n' or '\r'
2. Api should be redesigned completely :
   Json g; // g = null;
   Json a = "string";
   Json b = 123.4e-05;
   Json c = true;
   Json d = false;
   Json e = make_object({{"hello", 123}, {"world", true}});
   Json f = make_array({a, b, c, d});
   
3. make_array() and make_object();
4. apply the jsonat in another project to read and write the configure files.
5. it should be able to use like a["address"]["street"], or b[4][1].
6. maybe support the comments...? (not the standard in JSON)
   i.e. : {"age" : "18" /* this is the comment */} // all rights a comment too
   I think it could implement by two pass parsing. (first for the comments, 
   second for the data)
7. roundtrip test.
